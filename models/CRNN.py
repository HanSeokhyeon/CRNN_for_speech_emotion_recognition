class CRNN(nn.Module):
    r"""
    Applies a multi-layer RNN to an input sequence.

    Args:
        hidden_size (int): the number of features in the hidden state `h`
        input_dropout_p (float, optional): dropout probability for the input sequence (default: 0)
        dropout_p (float, optional): dropout probability for the output sequence (default: 0)
        n_layers (int, optional): number of recurrent layers (default: 1)
        bidirectional (bool, optional): if True, becomes a bidirectional encodr (defulat False)
        rnn_cell (str, optional): type of RNN cell (default: gru)
        variable_lengths (bool, optional): if use variable length RNN (default: False)

    Inputs: inputs, input_lengths
        - **inputs**: list of sequences, whose length is the batch size and within which each sequence is a list of token IDs.
        - **input_lengths** (list of int, optional): list that contains the lengths of sequences
            in the mini-batch, it must be provided when using variable length RNN (default: `None`)

    Outputs: output, hidden
        - **output** (batch, seq_len, hidden_size): tensor containing the encoded features of the input sequence
        - **hidden** (num_layers * num_directions, batch, hidden_size): tensor containing the features in the hidden state `h`

    Examples::

        >>> model = CRNN(hidden_size)
        >>> output, hidden = model(input)
